 <h1>About Me</h1>
 
 <h2>Katrina Caraballo</h2>

  
 <p>I'm from Springfield, Massachusets and currently residing in Chicopee, Massachusetts. I graduated from Elms College with a degree in graphic design
    and a minor in cyber security. I'm detail oriented, and creative. I like to bring in some creativity in my everyday work if its permitted.
    I enjoy working independently and I'm self-motivated. I like to work on side projects like painting, drawing, or redecorating. 
    I enjoy working with a team as well, and like collaborating with others. I have an interest in the cyber security field, 
	and in programming. I'm still trying to find my niche in the IT field, but I'm ready to learn more and strengthen my skill set.
